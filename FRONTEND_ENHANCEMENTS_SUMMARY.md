// Action states
const [actionLoading, setActionLoading] = useState(false);
const [successMessage, setSuccessMessage] = useState('');
const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState('');
```

### API Integration
```javascript
// Real API calls instead of console.log
const response = await api.post('/endpoint', data);
if (response.data.success) {
  setSuccessMessage('Operation successful!');
  await fetchDashboardData(); // Refresh data
}
```

### Modal Components
```javascript
{showModal && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center z-50">
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 max-w-2xl w-full mx-4">
